But the problem says \"detect all sheep heads\", so we need to list each.\n\nWait, but maybe some of these are not heads. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the sheep's head is the region containing the face. So for each sheep, the head is the part with the face and ears.\n\nLet's check a few:\n\n- The sheep in the front left: [155, 490, 268, 602] – yes, that's the head.\n\n- The sheep next to it: [313, 358, 393, 444] – head.\n\n- The sheep behind them: [216, 372, 296, 462] – head.\n\n- The sheep on the far left: [77, 378, 144, 474] – head.\n\nYes, those are all heads.\n\nNow, let's list all of them as JSON.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let's try to list as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's count the number of sheep heads.\n\nLooking at the image, there are many sheep. Let's see:\n\nIn the foreground, there are several. Let's count:\n\nLeft to right, top to bottom.\n\n1. Leftmost sheep: head [0, 467, 164, 647] – no, the head is part of it. Wait, no. The head is the face. Let's take the first sheep on the left: its head is [0, 467, 164, 647]? No, that's the body. The head is from the top of the head to the neck. So the head is [0, 467, 164, 647] – but the sheep's body is below. Wait, no. The head is the upper part. So for the leftmost sheep, the head is [0, 467, 164, 647] – but that's the whole sheep. Wait, no, the sheep is standing, so the head is the top part.\n\nWait, maybe the correct bounding box for the head is the area where the face is visible.\n\nLet's look at the sheep with the black face: [215, 372, 297, 463] – that's the head.\n\nAnother sheep with black face: [407, 347, 497, 459] – head.\n\nAnother: [598, 207, 669, 292] – head.\n\nSo, let's list all:\n\n1.

Let's check a few.\n\nFor example, the sheep at the top right: [829, 55, 869, 109] – that's a head.\n\nAnother one: [932, 172, 998, 257] – yes, that's a head.\n\nNow, let's format this as JSON.\n\nEach object is {\"bbox_2d\": [x1, y1, x2, y2], \"label\": \"sheep head\"}\n\nBut the problem says \"detect all sheep heads\", so the label is \"sheep head\".\n\nWait, the example output was for \"cat\", so here it's \"sheep head\".\n\nSo the JSON array will have each entry as {\"bbox_2d\": [...], \"label\": \"sheep head\"}\n\nNow, let's list all the bounding boxes we identified.\n\nLet's make sure each is correct.\n\nFor example:\n\n- [77, 378, 144, 474] – head of the sheep behind the leftmost one.\n\n- [136, 339, 202, 421] – head.\n\n- [155, 490, 268, 602] – front left sheep.\n\n- [197, 317, 251, 389] – sheep behind the front left.\n\n- [216, 372, 296, 462] – sheep with black face.\n\n- [281, 339, 329, 426] – sheep behind the black-faced one.\n\n- [308, 288, 356, 354] – sheep in the middle left.\n\n- [313, 358, 393, 444] – sheep in front middle.\n\n- [356, 300, 406, 376] – sheep behind the front middle.\n\n- [395, 300, 438, 360] – sheep further back.\n\n- [408, 347, 496, 458] – sheep with black face.\n\n- [429, 432, 520, 561] – sheep in front middle.\n\n- [455, 287, 523, 371] – sheep behind.\n\n- [458, 230, 514, 302] – sheep at the top middle.\n\n- [495, 390, 598, 486] – sheep in front middle right.\n\n- [503, 485, 606, 609] – sheep in front right.\n\n- [518, 255, 584, 334] – sheep behind.\n\n- [548, 310, 628, 402] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [562, 468, 706, 582] – sheep behind.\n\n- [599, 208, 668, 291] – sheep with brown face.\n\n- [609, 340, 676, 425] – sheep behind.\n\n- [621, 171, 673, 222] – sheep at top.\n\n- [638, 385, 725, 470] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [665, 204, 711, 265] – sheep behind.\n\n- [680, 158, 726, 206] – sheep at top right.\n\n- [687, 308, 736, 357] – sheep behind.\n\n- [693, 421, 806, 546] – sheep in front right.\n\n- [703, 209, 751, 270] – sheep behind.\n\n- [712, 311, 786, 388] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [716, 162, 751, 218] – sheep at top.\n\n- [731, 141, 766, 177] – sheep at top.\n\n- [742, 168, 800, 240] – sheep behind.\n\n- [762, 353, 878, 483] – sheep in front right.\n\n- [778, 126, 812, 160] – sheep at top.\n\n- [788, 211, 853, 286] – sheep behind.\n\n- [809, 111, 832, 144] – sheep at top.\n\n- [810, 116, 859, 172] – sheep at top.\n\n- [830, 56, 869, 109] – sheep at top.\n\n- [839, 141, 896, 224] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [841, 11, 876, 63] – sheep at top.\n\n- [872, 30, 906, 80] – sheep at top.\n\n- [888, 148, 932, 199] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [898, 38, 930, 88] – sheep at top.\n\n- [903, 101, 943, 154] – sheep at top.\n\n- [932, 172, 998, 257] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [933, 97, 974, 149] – sheep at top.\n\n- [948, 1, 977, 31] – sheep at top.\n\n- [973, 1, 999, 40] – sheep at top.\n\nNow, let's check if all these are valid. Some might be overlapping, but the task is to detect all heads.\n\nNow, format this into JSON.\n",

The sheep on the far left, the one with the yellow tag: [0, 467, 164, 647] – wait, no, the head is part of that. Wait, no, the task is to detect the heads. Wait, no, the problem says \"detect all sheep heads\". So each head is a region.\n\nWait, let's list all sheep heads. Let's check each sheep's head.\n\nFirst, the sheep in the foreground left: [154, 490, 269, 602] – that's a head.\n\nThen, the sheep next to it: [323, 357, 395, 444] – head.\n\nAnother one: [135, 338, 202, 421] – head.\n\nWait, let's count all heads. Let's see:\n\nLooking at the image, each sheep has a head.

Wait, no, the head is the upper part. Wait, the problem says \"sheep heads\", so each head is a bounding box for the head.\n\nWait, let's identify each head:\n\n1. [0, 467, 164, 647] – no, that's the whole sheep. Wait, no, the head is the part with the face. Let's check:\n\nFor example, the sheep on the far left: its head is [0, 467, 164, 647]? No, that's the whole body. Wait, no. Let's look at the sheep's head.\n\nWait, maybe better to list each head:\n\n- Leftmost sheep (small): [0, 467, 164, 647] – no, the head is part of that.

Let's check if some of these are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the image has around 50 sheep heads. But the problem says \"detect all sheep heads\", so we need to list each.\n\nWait, but maybe some of these are not heads. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the sheep's head is the region containing the face. So for each sheep, the head is the part with the face and ears.\n\nLet's check a few:\n\n- The sheep in the front left: [155, 490, 268, 602] – yes, that's the head.\n\n- The sheep next to it: [313, 358, 393, 444] – head.\n\n- The sheep behind them: [216, 372, 296, 462] – head.\n\n- The sheep on the far left: [77, 378, 144, 474] – head.\n\nYes, those are all heads.\n\nNow, let's list all of them as JSON.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let's try to list as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's count the number of sheep heads.\n\nLooking at the image, there are many sheep. Let's see:\n\nIn the foreground, there are several. Let's count:\n\nLeft to right, top to bottom.\n\n1. Leftmost sheep: head [0, 467, 164, 647] – no, the head is part of it. Wait, no. The head is the face. Let's take the first sheep on the left: its head is [0, 467, 164, 647]? No, that's the body. The head is from the top of the head to the neck. So the head is [0, 467, 164, 647] – but the sheep's body is below. Wait, no. The head is the upper part. So for the leftmost sheep, the head is [0, 467, 164, 647] – but that's the whole sheep. Wait, no, the sheep is standing, so the head is the top part.\n\nWait, maybe the correct bounding box for the head is the area where the face is visible.\n\nLet's look at the sheep with the black face: [215, 372, 297, 463] – that's the head.\n\nAnother sheep with black face: [407, 347, 497, 459] – head.\n\nAnother: [598, 207, 669, 292] – head.\n\nSo, let's list all:\n\n1.

Let's check if some of these are correct.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the image has around 50 sheep heads. But the problem says \"detect all sheep heads\", so we need to list each.\n\nWait, but maybe some of these are not heads. Let's think again.\n\nWait, the sheep's head is the region containing the face. So for each sheep, the head is the part with the face and ears.\n\nLet's check a few:\n\n- The sheep in the front left: [155, 490, 268, 602] – yes, that's the head.\n\n- The sheep next to it: [313, 358, 393, 444] – head.\n\n- The sheep behind them: [216, 372, 296, 462] – head.\n\n- The sheep on the far left: [77, 378, 144, 474] – head.\n\nYes, those are all heads.\n\nNow, let's list all of them as JSON.\n\nBut this is time-consuming. Let's try to list as many as possible.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a better way. Let's count the number of sheep heads.\n\nLooking at the image, there are many sheep. Let's see:\n\nIn the foreground, there are several. Let's count:\n\nLeft to right, top to bottom.\n\n1. Leftmost sheep: head [0, 467, 164, 647] – no, the head is part of it. Wait, no. The head is the face. Let's take the first sheep on the left: its head is [0, 467, 164, 647]? No, that's the body. The head is from the top of the head to the neck. So the head is [0, 467, 164, 647] – but the sheep's body is below. Wait, no. The head is the upper part. So for the leftmost sheep, the head is [0, 467, 164, 647] – but that's the whole sheep. Wait, no, the sheep is standing, so the head is the top part.\n\nWait, maybe the correct bounding box for the head is the area where the face is visible.\n\nLet's look at the sheep with the black face: [215, 372, 297, 463] – that's the head.\n\nAnother sheep with black face: [407, 347, 497, 459] – head.\n\nAnother: [598, 207, 669, 292] – head.\n\nSo, let's list all:\n\n1.

Let's check a few.\n\nFor example, the sheep at the top right: [829, 55, 869, 109] – that's a head.\n\nAnother one: [932, 172, 998, 257] – yes, that's a head.\n\nNow, let's format this as JSON.\n\nEach object is {\"bbox_2d\": [x1, y1, x2, y2], \"label\": \"sheep head\"}\n\nBut the problem says \"detect all sheep heads\", so the label is \"sheep head\".\n\nWait, the example output was for \"cat\", so here it's \"sheep head\".\n\nSo the JSON array will have each entry as {\"bbox_2d\": [...], \"label\": \"sheep head\"}\n\nNow, let's list all the bounding boxes we identified.\n\nLet's make sure each is correct.\n\nFor example:\n\n- [77, 378, 144, 474] – head of the sheep behind the leftmost one.\n\n- [136, 339, 202, 421] – head.\n\n- [155, 490, 268, 602] – front left sheep.\n\n- [197, 317, 251, 389] – sheep behind the front left.\n\n- [216, 372, 296, 462] – sheep with black face.\n\n- [281, 339, 329, 426] – sheep behind the black-faced one.\n\n- [308, 288, 356, 354] – sheep in the middle left.\n\n- [313, 358, 393, 444] – sheep in front middle.\n\n- [356, 300, 406, 376] – sheep behind the front middle.\n\n- [395, 300, 438, 360] – sheep further back.\n\n- [408, 347, 496, 458] – sheep with black face.\n\n- [429, 432, 520, 561] – sheep in front middle.\n\n- [455, 287, 523, 371] – sheep behind.\n\n- [458, 230, 514, 302] – sheep at the top middle.\n\n- [495, 390, 598, 486] – sheep in front middle right.\n\n- [503, 485, 606, 609] – sheep in front right.\n\n- [518, 255, 584, 334] – sheep behind.\n\n- [548, 310, 628, 402] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [562, 468, 706, 582] – sheep behind.\n\n- [599, 208, 668, 291] – sheep with brown face.\n\n- [609, 340, 676, 425] – sheep behind.\n\n- [621, 171, 673, 222] – sheep at top.\n\n- [638, 385, 725, 470] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [665, 204, 711, 265] – sheep behind.\n\n- [680, 158, 726, 206] – sheep at top right.\n\n- [687, 308, 736, 357] – sheep behind.\n\n- [693, 421, 806, 546] – sheep in front right.\n\n- [703, 209, 751, 270] – sheep behind.\n\n- [712, 311, 786, 388] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [716, 162, 751, 218] – sheep at top.\n\n- [731, 141, 766, 177] – sheep at top.\n\n- [742, 168, 800, 240] – sheep behind.\n\n- [762, 353, 878, 483] – sheep in front right.\n\n- [778, 126, 812, 160] – sheep at top.\n\n- [788, 211, 853, 286] – sheep behind.\n\n- [809, 111, 832, 144] – sheep at top.\n\n- [810, 116, 859, 172] – sheep at top.\n\n- [830, 56, 869, 109] – sheep at top.\n\n- [839, 141, 896, 224] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [841, 11, 876, 63] – sheep at top.\n\n- [872, 30, 906, 80] – sheep at top.\n\n- [888, 148, 932, 199] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [898, 38, 930, 88] – sheep at top.\n\n- [903, 101, 943, 154] – sheep at top.\n\n- [932, 172, 998, 257] – sheep in middle right.\n\n- [933, 97, 974, 149] – sheep at top.\n\n- [948, 1, 977, 31] – sheep at top.\n\n- [973, 1, 999, 40] – sheep at top.\n\nNow, let's check if all these are valid.
